Interactive Exercises  presents 30+ turtle  challenges to the learner that the learner may complete using the various blocks present in TurtleBlocksJS.
The challenges are based on the various blocks present in turtleblocksJS and provide a interactive and fun way to learn programming with turtleblocks. 

The exercises present here have been developed taking inspiration from
*Cynthia Solomon and Seymour Papert* Blog  [just logo things](https://logothings.github.io/logothings/)

Barry Newell’s 1988 book, *Turtle Confusion: Logo Puzzles and
Riddles*. Gary Stager has posted a [scan of Newells book](http://constructingmodernknowledge.com/tcbook.pdf) (with
permission of the author) ([en español](http://github.com/downloads/humitos/turtle-confusion-es/la-confusion-de-la-tortuga.pdf)).

Below is a collection of Turtle Blocks Exercises  stored on the Planet
that presents different challenges to be solved.

----

1. Click on a exercises from the images below (or by searching for
'Challenge' on the Planet).

2. Use blocks from the various Turtle Block palettes to instruct the
Logo turtle to replicate the pattern.

3. You can redisplay the challenge image at any time by typing "Alt-P" or pressing the run button.

Most of the challenges are problems of symmetry and geometry which
typically can be solved by using a combination of rotations and repeat
blocks. You may have to use the *Pen Up* and *Pen Down* blocks on
occasion.

*Stage 1:* **The forward Block**           |*Stage 2:* **The Right Block**         |*Stage 3:* **Other Side**
The forward block in the turtle palette is used to move the turtle forward by units passed as argument to the block.It is one of the basic turtle command.  |  The Right Block in the turtle palette is used to rotate the turtle right by given degree units passed as argument to the block.It is one of the basic turtle command.|Make the turtle move north east by 200 units using the blocks you learned about the previous two stages that is both the forward and right block.

Make the turtle move north West by 200 units using the blocks you learned about the previous two stages that is both the forward and right block. |  The SETXY Block in the turtle palette is used to move the turtle to the given co-ordinates passed as an argument to the block.It is one of the basic turtle command.| Boxes let you store an object, e.g., a number, and then refer to the object by using the name of the box.learn boxes by using them in the above exercise.

Change  the color of the pen and complete the specified task . The Pen color Block is available in the pen palette . |  Using the Fill blocks from the Pen palette to make a solid square (what ever is drawn inside the Fill clamp will be filled upon exiting the clamp.)|Conditionals are a powerful tool in computing.The basic idea is that if a condition is true, then take some action.Variants include  if-then-else,while,until,and forever.
