*Stage 1:* **The forward Block**           |*Stage 2:* **The Right Block**         |*Stage 3:* **Other Side**
The forward block in the turtle palette is used to move the turtle forward by units passed as argument to the block.It is one of the basic turtle command.  |  The Right Block in the turtle palette is used to rotate the turtle right by given degree units passed as argument to the block.It is one of the basic turtle command.|Make the turtle move West by 200 units using the blocks you learned about the previous two stages .

*Stage 4:* **North West**           |*Stage 5:* **The SetXY Block**         |*Stage 6:* **The Box Palette**
Make the turtle move north West by 200 units using the blocks you learned about the previous two stages that is both the forward and right block. |  The SETXY Block in the turtle palette is used to move the turtle to the given co-ordinates passed as an argument to the block.It is one of the basic turtle command.| Boxes let you store an object, e.g., a number, and then refer to the object by using the name of the box.Learn about boxes by using them in the above exercise.

*Stage 7:* **The Pen Color Block**           |*Stage 8:* **The Background Block**         |*Stage 9:* **The If Else Block**
Change  the color of the pen and complete the specified task . The Pen color Block is available in the pen palette . |  The Background block is used to change the colour of background simply use the background block. You can change color by using the color block first.|Conditionals are a powerful tool in computing.The basic idea is that if a condition is true, then take some action.Variants include  if-then-else,while,until,and forever.

*Stage 10:* **The Square:Repeat Block**            |*Stage 11:* **Fill Square**         |*Stage 12:* **Last Stage-Easy**
The Sequence of instructions are continually repeated for number of times passed as argument| Fill blocks from the Pen palette to make a solid square (what ever is drawn inside the Fill clamp will be filled upon exiting the clamp.|Bonus Challenge : last stage Implement what you have learned in earlier stages and trace the stage to complete.
